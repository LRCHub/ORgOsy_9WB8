I don't know why I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end, and it doesn't matter how I cry
My tears of love are a waste of time

If I turn away, am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do

If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah-ah-ah, oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah-ah-ah

Can't let go, and it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily to you, my love
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do

If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah-ah-ah, oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah-ah-ah, oh

If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah-ah-ah, oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah-ah-ah (I'm in love with nobody)

If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah-ah-ah, oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah-ah-ah, no
