Yo, it's a big world
You probably think, I'm out there being a playa, huh?
But yo, but if I can't have you, then I don't want anybody
That's my word, so check it out
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, no
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, oh, oh
You've got the latest fashion
E-classin', body's just smashin', time for some action
When I hooked you up, then I hooked up my last one
All and all, got a joint cash fund
Forget your last one, he ain't much
Mad, 'cuz it's me, not him you touch
In the night time, when the lights go out
No doubt, Rich Nice is the name you shout
Yes, yes, y'all until the break of dawn
And yeah, yeah, that's it, don't stop
Don't quit, babygirl and Rich, we're always into something
If it's not you, then it's nothing
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, no
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, oh, oh
One, two, three, four, five
Baby just keep it moving all night
Need ya by my side from dark to sunlight
Everything is side to side is alright, uh
Listen, we can break fool, baby, act crazy
Make ways like a pool or maybe
We can shake the dawn breaks, girl, face it
Anything you want, girl, just take it
Shine bright like constellations
Girl, you got my heart, congratulations
No need to lie, you da meaning to this song
When it's on, then it's on and it's on, right
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, no
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, oh, oh
Clap to this, come on
Clap your hands, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
I think about you often
Let's take a little walk out in Boston
Hit boutiques, then freak on Lansdowne Street around ten
Lay low like Brasco, let's spend a few ends
And I rhyme for you, do time for you
Calculate and carry out the perfect crime for you
Let me shine with you, true, you won't regret it
But if it's not you, then forget it, forget it
I don't want nobody else but you
Nobody, nobody
Something 'bout those freaky things you do
Ain't no one else but you
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, no
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, oh, oh
If I can't have you, then I don't want nobody
If I can't have you, then I don't want no one
If I can't have you, then I don't want nobody
If I can't have you, then I don't want no one
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, no
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, oh, oh
