I want you beside me
I want you to be with me everyday
'Cause what would I do
Oh if I can't have you?
I want you to guide me
Helping me see the light of day
'Cause I'll be sad and blue
Oh if I can't have you
(If I can't have you)
I'll be your daddy honey
I'll be your little boy
I'll give you all my money
I'll give you all my joy
And when your days are sunny
Those days I won't destroy
Ooh baby I'm giving, I'm giving
Giving, I'm giving, I'm giving
It all to you
Everything
Hoping you feel like giving it too
'Cause I'll be sad and blue
Oh if I can't have you
(If I can't have you)

You get me so excited
You make it so unreal
No matter how I fight it
That's just the way I feel
Don't take your love and hide it
Don't stop a spinning wheel
Ooh baby I'm giving I'm giving

You are everything
Hoping you feel like giving it too
'Cause I'll be sad and blue
Oh if I can't have
What would I do, oh yeah
What would I do if I can't have you?
(If I can't have you)
