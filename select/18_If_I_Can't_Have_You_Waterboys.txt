I want you babe, I don't want nobody else
I want you babe, I don't want nobody else
If you don't want me, then I don't want myself

I need you babe, I need you, need your help
I need you babe, I need you bad, I need you, Lord I need you, need your help
If you ain't there baby, I ain't gonna need myself

I'm hurting for you babe, I'm hurting like hell
Yeah, I'm hurting for you baby, I'm hurting like hell
If you ain't hurting for me too, I'm gonna hurt myself
