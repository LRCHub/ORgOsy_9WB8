Chorus
I can't have you, and I don't have money
And if I can't have you, I don't want any.
Cause if I don't have you
Tell me what'll do
We've got no love and I've got nothing.

For what it's worth, I've given up wishing
To fill my life
But with all that's missing
And my peace of mind
Follows you everytime you take flight

Chorus

And when you land
I'll be waiting
To catch your eye
And see if there's something left inside
or are we wasting yours and mine, contemplating

Chorus
OH!
OH!
OH!
Chorus (repeat)
